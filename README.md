# Quality Graphs for oligo based normalization in microarray data.

## This package contains functions to perform the quality control analysis for microarray data

- \strong{densityplotAll_oligo} : Plot with log2 raw intensities in density plots.
- \strong{boxplotAll_oligo} : Plot with log2 raw intensities in boxplots.
- \strong{clusterdend} : Plot dendrograms with methods: ward.D2, average and complete and distances: Correlations and euclidean
- \strong{makePCA} : 3D plot with a principal component analysis (PCA)
- \strong{qualityplots_oligo} : A shortcut to call all the previous plots.

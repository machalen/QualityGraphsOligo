# Quality Graphs for oligo based normalization in microarray data.

## This package contains functions to perform the quality control analysis for microarray data

- **densityplotAll_oligo** : Plot with log2 raw intensities in density plots.
- **boxplotAll_oligo** : Plot with log2 raw intensities in boxplots.
- **clusterdend** : Plot dendrograms with methods: ward.D2, average and complete and distances: Correlations and euclidean
- **makePCA** : 3D plot with a principal component analysis (PCA)
- **qualityplots_oligo** : A shortcut to call all the previous plots.
